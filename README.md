... a 'helper' site alongside my maths teaching. I will use this to help children learn curriculum maths by coding computer games.  

I have worked in many types of school with many pupils who have been excluded from mainstream education. Often, children don't see the point of maths when learnt from a textbook. In games, maths makes the coding work. Without maths; no game. This is my hands-on approach to pedagogy in action: playing a video on coding a Scratch game and checking, in the video, if the students understand the maths involved. If not, a video loads to explain it.

Bear in mind, this is not a replacement for hands on, face-to-face learning, but an aid.

I am also currently 'fully in' on AI, and several repositories will appear next on this subject, in Python and Pytorch.

Previously, I have rather loved C++ (thanks, in no small part, to Bjarne Stroustrup's dryly witty writing), and am a member of ACCU.

Here are some C++ projects (also available in the repositories)...
